<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Flow Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-Intrusive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic flow testers can be categorized into two types: intrusive and non-intrusive. Intrusive flow testers require physical contact with the flow stream to take measurements, such as using a probe inserted into a pipe. On the other hand, non-intrusive flow testers can measure flow without coming into direct contact with the stream, often using sensors placed on the outside of the pipe. Both types of flow testers have their own advantages and applications depending on the specific requirements of the user.</p></p>
