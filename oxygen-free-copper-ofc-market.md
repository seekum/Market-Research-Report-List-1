<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Free Copper (OFC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrolytic-Tough-Pitch (ETP)</li><li>Oxygen-Free (OF)</li><li>Oxygen-Free Electronic (OFE)</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oxygen Free Copper (OFC) is classified into different types based on their oxygen content and purity levels. Electrolytic-Tough-Pitch (ETP) copper is the most common type, containing small amounts of oxygen that do not significantly affect its conductivity. Oxygen-Free (OF) copper has lower oxygen content than ETP, resulting in higher conductivity. Oxygen-Free Electronic (OFE) copper is the purest form, with extremely low oxygen levels for optimal performance in electronic applications. Other types of OFC include oxygen-free high thermal conductivity (OFHC) copper for thermal management applications.</p></p>
