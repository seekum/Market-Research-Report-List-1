<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Friction Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Asbestos Friction Material</li><li>No Asbestos Friction Material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Brake Friction Materials market types can be categorized into two main categories: Asbestos Friction Material and No Asbestos Friction Material. Asbestos Friction Material used to be widely used in the past due to its heat-resistant properties, but it has been banned in many countries due to health risks. No Asbestos Friction Material, on the other hand, is now the preferred choice for brake pads as it offers similar performance without the health hazards associated with asbestos. These two categories define the main types of brake friction materials available in the market today.</p></p>
