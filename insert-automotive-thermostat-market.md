<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insert Automotive Thermostat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standard Automotive Thermostat</li><li>MAP-Controlled Automotive Thermostat</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The standard automotive thermostat is a traditional type of thermostat that operates based on the temperature of the engine coolant alone. It opens and closes to regulate the flow of coolant between the engine and radiator. On the other hand, the MAP-controlled automotive thermostat monitors both the engine coolant temperature and the intake air temperature to adjust coolant flow accordingly. This type of thermostat provides more precise control over engine temperature, leading to improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions.</p></p>
