<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semi-elliptical Leaf Spring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-leaf Spring</li><li>Mono-leaf Spring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semi-elliptical leaf springs are commonly classified into two main types in the market: multi-leaf spring and mono-leaf spring. Multi-leaf springs consist of several layers of curved spring steel strips stacked on top of each other, providing greater load-carrying capacity and more flexibility. On the other hand, mono-leaf springs are made of a single continuous piece of spring steel, offering a smoother ride but with less weight-carrying capability. Both types cater to different market needs based on varying requirements for load capacity and ride quality.</p></p>
