<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photocured Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free-radical Type Photoinitiator</li><li>Cationic Type Photoinitiator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photocured materials market consists of two main types of photoinitiators: free-radical type and cationic type. Free-radical type photoinitiators work by generating free radicals upon exposure to light, which initiate the polymerization process. Cationic type photoinitiators, on the other hand, work by generating cations, which also initiate the polymerization process. Both types of photoinitiators are widely used in industries such as adhesives, coatings, and 3D printing for their ability to quickly and efficiently cure materials upon exposure to light.</p></p>
