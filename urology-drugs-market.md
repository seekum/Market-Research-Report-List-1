<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urology Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Α (alpha) Blockers</li><li>5 α-reductase Inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urology drugs can be classified into two main types: Alpha (α) blockers and 5 α-reductase inhibitors. Alpha blockers are medications that help relax the muscles in the prostate and the bladder neck, relieving symptoms such as difficulty urinating. On the other hand, 5 α-reductase inhibitors reduce the production of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone, which contributes to the growth of the prostate gland. These inhibitors effectively shrink the prostate over time, helping to alleviate urinary symptoms caused by an enlarged prostate. Both types of drugs are commonly used to treat urological conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia.</p></p>
