<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Lung Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venovenous (VV) Artificial Lung Devices</li><li>Venoarterial (VA) Artificial Lung Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial Lung Devices are medical devices used to assist or replace the function of the lungs. There are two main types of Artificial Lung Devices on the market: Venovenous (VV) and Venoarterial (VA). VV devices function by removing blood from a vein, oxygenating it, and then returning it to the body. VA devices, on the other hand, remove blood from a vein, oxygenate it, and then return it to an artery. Both types of devices are crucial in providing life-saving support to patients with respiratory failure.</p></p>
