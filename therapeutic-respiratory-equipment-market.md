<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Therapeutic Respiratory Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Devices</li><li>Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Therapeutic respiratory equipment market includes various types of devices used to assist in improving respiratory functions. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) devices are commonly used to treat sleep apnea by delivering a continuous stream of pressurized air to keep the airway open. Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) devices are similar to CPAP but deliver two different levels of air pressure – one for inhalation and a lower pressure for exhalation. Both devices are non-invasive and help to improve breathing and overall respiratory health.</p></p>
