<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cell Phone Cellular Repeaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Signal Booster</li><li>Digital Signal Booster</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cell Phone Cellular Repeaters come in two main types: Analog Signal Boosters and Digital Signal Boosters. Analog Signal Boosters amplify the existing analog signal from cell towers to improve voice calls and text messaging. Digital Signal Boosters, on the other hand, work by converting the analog signal to digital and then amplifying it for improved voice calls, text messaging, and data speeds. Both types of repeaters are essential in boosting cell phone signals in areas with weak coverage.</p></p>
