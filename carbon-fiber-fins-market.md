<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Fins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pure Carbon</li><li>Mixed Carbon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon fiber fins are divided into two main types based on their construction: pure carbon and mixed carbon. Pure carbon fins are made entirely of carbon fiber, providing maximum stiffness and responsiveness in the water. On the other hand, mixed carbon fins combine carbon fiber with other materials such as fiberglass or resin to achieve a balance of performance and affordability. Both types of fins offer superior strength-to-weight ratio, durability, and overall performance for divers and swimmers looking for high-quality equipment.</p></p>
