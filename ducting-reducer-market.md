<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ducting Reducer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric Reducer</li><li>Eccentric Reducer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ducting reducer market consists of two main types: concentric reducer and eccentric reducer. A concentric reducer is a pipe fitting that connects pipes of different diameters in a straight line, with both ends having a central axis. This type provides a smooth transition between pipes, minimizing turbulence and pressure loss. On the other hand, an eccentric reducer is a fitting that connects pipes of different diameters misaligned, with one end offset from the other. It helps to maintain the same fluid flow characteristics while simultaneously preventing build-up and accumulation. Both types serve different purposes in ducting systems.</p></p>
