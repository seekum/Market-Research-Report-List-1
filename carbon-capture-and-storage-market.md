<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Capture and Storage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Combustion Carbon Capture</li><li>Oxy-Combustion Carbon Capture</li><li>Post-Combustion Carbon Capture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology includes three main market types: Pre-Combustion Carbon Capture, which captures carbon dioxide before combustion by converting fossil fuels into a synthetic gas; Oxy-Combustion Carbon Capture, which burns fuel in an oxygen-rich environment to produce a stream of almost pure carbon dioxide; and Post-Combustion Carbon Capture, which captures carbon dioxide from flue gases after combustion. These market types provide different methods for capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes and power plants.</p></p>
